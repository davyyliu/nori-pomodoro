## Description:

Nori Pomodoro is a full stack web app greatly inspired by the Pomodoro studying technique. As someone who has a passion for continous learning and wants to study for longer sessions, this is extremely helpful. The theme of this web app is that of zen with a backdrop of Mt Fuji; in addition, a soothing bell rings at each completed session.

Not only does this web app enables for better studying, it also has some unique quirks such as enabling the parallax effect on the background and being able to retain your progress if the web app exits for whatever reason. In addition, you'll be able to access the same kind of progress if you login to the same account on a different computer or even your phone! This is all possible by injecting and extracting data into and from the database when needed. Also, you will be able to view all your Pomodoro sessions via the history page, where the data is provided through API calls to the database.
